# Algorithm-for-tank-game
Using A-star shortest path algorithm

Source: https://github.com/ThanhDinhDat/tankgame-tn14

Problem: provide an algorithm for nextmove() in IPlayer class for each tank to automatically move and destroy the enemy's HQ. It is possible to use all the functions in IGameInfo, IPlayerInfo, IMap, IBlock, IBridge, ITank, IHeadquarter, ISpring classes.

Solution:using A-star shortest path algorithm to find the path for all tanks to go back and protect HQ. If in case the enemy's HQ in our range on the way back to our HQ and number of bullets of the tank is greater than HP of the enemy's HQ, our tank will fire the enemy's HQ.

Team: 4 members.

Position: team leader.
